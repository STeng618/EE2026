### Analysis 
This folder contains the code for the analysis module. The analysis module is responsible for analysing user inputs and determining whether the user has passed the Captcha game. The analysis verifies absolute errors between the user inputs and the draw sequences of the characters, and also quantifies the similarity between the user inputs and the draw sequences of the characters through kendall tau distance.

Analysis is shown on the screen after the user has completed the Captcha game.
